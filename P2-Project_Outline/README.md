# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
I would like to create an app for people who are trying to track how the foods they eat impact their wellbeing. It will be designed to track diet, activity, mood, and general wellbeing. User inputs would include what foods and supplements you are ingesting, and scale ratings for specific parameters (how user is feeling overall, sleep level, activity level, and any intestinal issues). Data would then translate into graphs correlating the foods you eat to how you feel. Ideally, this program could be used to track food intolerance/allergic reactions, as well as effects of certain activities (exercise, sleep habits) or effects of other substances (coffee, energy drinks, alcohol, supplements). 

User Story Example 1: I want to eliminate dairy from my diet, in order to determine if I am lactose intolerant. I record servings of dairy ingested per day, and variables such as energy level, weight, feelings of bloat or intestinal distress, etc. Data is then stored in relational databases and presents back to me a chart/description that indicates whether the levels of dairy I've ingested have had any effect on my digestion and overall wellbeing over a given time period.
  
User Story Example 2: I keep getting stomach aches, and can't pinpoint what is causing it. Once I start recording the foods I'm eating, as well as when the stomach aches occur, the program can show me the potential foods that could be triggering it. 
  
User Story Example 3: I work out several times per week. I've notice that some days I have a lot of energy, and some days I'm dragging at the gym. I could use this program to determine what I've eaten in the hours leading up to my best workouts- in effect, which foods are best at fueling my body. I can use this information to "level up" my diet and improve my workouts.


### Features
Features for this app will include user input forms, databases that store information pertaining to diet, levels of activity, and how the user feels in general (possibly tracking sleep, mood, etc.), and graphs that will visually display any patterns. Ideally, the app would also be able to communicate back to the user some results that could help the user to identify patterns or trends happening as a result of their lifestyle. If I had the skills to make it happen, another potential feature of this app could also be to recommend targeted vitamins or foods based on the user data and what they are lacking from their diet. 

### Technologies
I plan to use IntelliJ to build this with Java and Spring Boot, mySql databases, and perhaps Gradle? (We used this is some of our assignments). 

### What I'll Have to Learn
I feel very comfortable with creating a landing page, user input forms, and databases. What I will need to learn is how to transform the database data into graphs/charts that can be viewed by the user, and also how to get the program to analyze the user's data in order to return a useful conclusion/result statement back to the user.
